### REVIEW QUESTIONS


## True/False

#  1. Linear search requires a number of steps proportional to the size of the list being searched. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p. 464 "Let's consider linear search first. If we have a list of ten items, the most
#     work our algorithm might have to do is to look at each item in turn. The loop will iterate at most
#     ten times. Suppose the list is twice as big. Then it might have to look at twice as many items."]

#  2. The python operator in performs a binary search. ?

#  3. Binary search is an n log n algorithm. FALSE
#     [Note: cf. 9.]

#  4. The number of times n can be divided by 2 is exp(n). ?

#  5. All proper recursive definitions must have exactly one non-recursive base case. TRUE

#  6. A sequence can be viewed as a recursive data collection. TRUE

#  7. A word of length n has n! anagrams. TRUE

#  8. Loops are more general than recursion. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.474 "...recursive functions are a generalization of loops." 

#  9. Merge sort is an example of n log n algorithm.

# 10. Exponential algorithms are generally considered intractable. TRUE
