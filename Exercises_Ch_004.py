### REVIEW QUESTIONS


## True/False

#  1. Using graphics.py allows graphics to be drawn in a Python shell window. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.86: "The GraphWin() function creates a new window on the screen....The GraphWin
#     may overlap your Python shell window, so you might have to resize or move the shell to make
#     both windows fully visible."]

#  2. Traditionally, the upper-left corner of a graphics window has coordinates (0,0). TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.88: "Traditionally, graphics programmers locate the point (0,0) in the upper-left
#     corner of the window,"]

#  3. A single point on a graphics screen is called a pixel. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.88: "A graphics winow is actually a collection of tiny points called pixels
#     (short for 'picture elements')."]

#  4. A function that creates a new instance of a class is called an accessor. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.91: "To create a new instance of a class, we use a special operation called a
#     constructor. A call to a constructor is an expression that creates a brand new object."
#     p.92: Methods that "allows us to access information from the instance variables of the object"
#     are called "accessors."]

#  5. Instance variables are used to store data inside an object. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.92: Values are stored inside an object as instance variables.]

#  6. The statement myShape.move(10,20) moves myShape to the point (10,20). FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.93: Specification of move method that all graphical objects have:
#     "move(dx, dy): Moves the object dx units in the x direction and dy units in the y direction."
#     Thus, the coordinates indicate movement, not position.]

#  7. Aliasing occurs when two variables refer to the same object. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.95: "This situation where two vairabiles refer to the same object is called
#     aliasing."]

#  8. The copy method is provided to make a copy of a graphics object. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.95: "The graphics library provides a better solution; all graphical objects support
#     a clone method that makes a copy of the object."]

#  9. A graphics window always has the title "Graphics Window." FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.98: "...the GraphWin constructor allows an optional parameter to specify the title
#     of the window."]

# 10. The method in the graphics library used to get a mouse click is readMouse. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.107: "When getMouse is invoked on a GraphWin, the program pauses and waits for the
#     user to click the mouse somewhere in the graphics window."


## Multiple Choice

#     a) mutator     b) function     c) constructor     d) accessor

#  2. A method that changes the state of an object is called a(n) [B]
#     a) stator     b) mutator     c) constructor     d) changor

#  3. What graphics class would be best for drawing a square?
#     a) Square     b) Polygon     c) Line     d) Rectangle

#  4. What command would set the coordiantes of win to go from (0,0) in the lower-left corner to (10,10) in the
#     upper-right?

#  5. What expression would create a line from (2,3) to (4,5)?

#  6. What command would be sued to draw the graphics object shape into the graphics window win?

#  7. Which of the following computes the horizontal distance between points p1 and p2?

#  8. What kind of ojbect can be used to get text input in a graphics window?

#  9. A user interface organized around visual elements and user actions is called a(n)

# 10. What color is color_rgb(0,255,255)?
