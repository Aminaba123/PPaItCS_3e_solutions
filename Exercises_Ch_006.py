### REVIEW QUESTIONS


## True/False

#  1. Programmers rarely define their own functions. FALSE
#     [Explanation: If this were true, programming would be boring. p.175: "[Programmers] design [their] own
#     own functions to make [their] programs easier to write and understand."

#  2. A function may only be called at one place in a program. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.177: "The basic idea of a function is that we write a sequence of statements and give
#     that sequence a name. The instructions can then be executed at any point in the program by referring
#     to the function name. The part of the program that creates a function is called a function definition.
#     When a function is subsequently used in a program, we say that the definition is called or invoked. A
#     single function definition may be called at many different points of a program."]

#  3. Information can be passed into a function through parameters. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.195: "...the formal parameters of a function only recevive the values of the actual
#     parameters."]

#  4. Every Python function returns some value. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.192: "Technically, all functions in Python eturn a value, regardless of whether the
#     function actaully contains a return statement. Functions without a return always hand back a special
#     object, denoted None."]

#  5. In Python, some parameters are passed by reference. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.195: "In programming language parlance, Python passes all parameters by value. ...
#     ...Python does not allow passing parameters by reference...".]

#  6. In Python, a function can return only one value. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.192: "Sometimes a function needs to return more than one value. This can be done by simply
#     listing more than one expression in the return statement."]

#  7. Python functions can never modify parameters. FALSE
#     [Note: This is true of OOP languages in general, I think, as opposed to functional programming languages.
#     Explanation: p.193: "In some cases, functions can also communicate back to the calling program by making
#     changes to the function parameters."]

#  8. One reason to use functions is to reduce code duplication. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.177 "Funcations can be used to reduce code duplication and to make programs more
#     understandable and easier to maintain."]

#  9. Variables defined in a function are local to that function. TRUE
#     [Explnation: p.183: "Scope refers to the places where a given variable may be referenced. Remember, each
#     function is its own little subprogram. The variables used inside on fuction are local to that function,
#     even if they happen to have the same name as variables that appear inside another function.
#     p.185: "Variables with identical names elsewhere in the program are distinc from the formal parameters
#     and variables inside the function body."]

# 10. It's a bad idea to define new functions if it makes a program longer. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.199: "So far, we have been discussing functions as a mechanism for reducing code
#     duplication, thus shortening and simplifying our programs. Surprisingly, functions are often used even
#     when doing so actually makes a program longer. A second reason for using functions is to make programs
#     more modular."]
