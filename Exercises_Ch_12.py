### REVIEW QUESTIONS


## True/False

#  1. Object-oriented design is the process of finding and defining a useful set of functions for solving a problem. FALSE
#     [Note: Sounds more like a definition related to functional programming.]

#  2. Candidate objects can be found by looking at the verbs in a problem description. FALSE
#     [Note: Going by intuition alone, objects should be based on nouns.]

#  3. Typically, the design process involves considerable trial and error. FALSE
#     [I would think that it is implentation is the source of trial and error.]

#  4. GUIs are often built with a model-view architecture. ?

#  5. Hiding the details of an object in a class definition is called instantiation. FALSE
#     [This is actually called encapsulation.]

#  6. Polymorphism literally means "many changes." TRUE

#  7. A superclass inherits behaviors from its subclasses. FALSE
#     [Note: Again going by intuition here, inheritance works the other way.]

#  8. GUIs are generally easier to write than text-based interfaces. FALSE
#     [GUIs can be extremely complicated, hence my response.]
